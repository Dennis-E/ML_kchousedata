# PgDip Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence

# Study group - House Pricing prediction

Hey guys, so far we have discussed a lot of statistics and python, but not much about machine learning. So I started to play with some models in python to practice what we have learned.

My goal is to keep improving my notebook as we advance on the course with new models and techniques. 

I found this dataset online that seems simple enough to start with, but also raise some questions that hopefully we will be able to answer with time.

If you want to join me and start to investigate the same dataset we can share ideas and improve our knowledge. I'm pasting here the .csv file together with my notebook.
